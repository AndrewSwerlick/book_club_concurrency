Reducers Internal
------------------
Reify is basically declaring a class that implements an interface

The make reducer function creates a class based on a transformation function you provide

Where does the parameter reducef get used

Think I still need more explanation as to how my-map works

I think it's like this
1. My map creates a reducer that transforms each value before passing to the reduce function
2. When using "into []" the reduce function is a cojoin function which adds to the empty array
3. This means we end transforming the value with the map function and then adding to the new array with the cojoin function


Questions
============

Video
----------
I really like the definition of map he gives around 16:30

Filtering - abscence of activity

reduce combine vs map reduce

The documentation for pcalls and pvaluesâ€”how do they differ from pmap? Is it possible to implement them in terms of pmap?
---------------
Pmap takes a single function and a collection and builds up a new collection

The other options take a series of functions and build up a new collection

You could implement the other ones in terms of pmap by treating the list of functions or expressions as a collection and defining a map function that evals the expressions
